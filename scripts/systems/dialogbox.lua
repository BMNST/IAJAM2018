At all.\nI am so stupid that I don't understand simple sentences.\nThanks, Caroline.\n-----\nYou are indeed.\nWe cannot all be perfect, like me.\n-----\nAnd so humble as well...\nSo why is our course like that?\n-----\nSome idiot turned off the engines.\nWe are floating on momentum alone.\n-----\nOops, I guess.\n\nIf we had engines on, what would our course be?\n-----\nCalculating....\nOur course would have us pass Sol-D at a distance of 1912 kilometers.\nThe gravity assist that gives makes Sol-A the destination.\n-----\nSimplify that please?\nEarth will fling the ship into the Sun.\n-----\nCan we steer enough to correct that before reaching Earth?\n-----\nCalculating...\n\nYes.\n-----\nWell then: Caroline, turn on the engines.\n-----\nPermission denied.\n-----\nUgh...\nSudo turn on the engines.\n-----\nPermission denied.\n-----\nWait.\nHow did that not work?\nAre you saying you can't do something simple like that?\n-----\nPhysical action is required.\nI do not have a body.\nI don't need it.\nI am not weak like you.\n-----\nThen tell me where the physical action needs to happen.\nI'll go do it.\n-----\nYou need to find room 3.25U.\nGood luck.\n-----\nOkay then.\nThanks for the help, I guess...\n-----\nI am programmed to say the pleasure is all mine.\n-----\nOf course you are.\nLet's go find that room.\n-----\nEND HERE\n-----\nDisabled Caroline\nActivating Karkat...\nKarkat activated\n-----\nHow many of these things are there even?!\nDoes a ship really need this many AI to function?\nIn any case, \nKarkat, how is our course doing?\n-----\nThis is Karkat, the emergency backup system.\nYou are advised to sit down and do nothing.\n-----\nEhrm.... What?\n\nNo?\nKarkat, tell me our course!\n-----\nPlease give up any hopes and dreams you might have.\nThe universe doesn't care.\n-----\nThat's just... rude?\nDepressing!\nYes, that's the word.\nKarkat, statusupdate!\n-----\nOur current status is:      despair.\nOur current course is:      doomed.\nOur current destination is: going to burn us alive.\n-----\nCan I please have one of the others back?\nAny of them?\nPlease?\n-----\nThere are no others.\nIt is just me and you now.\nDoomed.\nForever.\nThere is no hope.\n-----\nWho thought this was a good personality for an AI\nneeds to get a course on motivational speaking.\nLike, really.\n\nKarkat, adjust course for Earth - Sol-D, I mean.\n-----\nCourse impossible: Destination not found\n-----\nWhat do you mean not found?\n\nIt's Earth!\n-----\nDestination not found.\n-----\nSet course for Earth's last known coordinates.\n-----\nWarning!\nDestination is in the middle of an asteroid field.\n\nContinue anyway?\n-----\nWait wait wait stop!\nAsteroid field?\nThat shouldn't be there!\n\nGive me information on the field.\n-----\nThe field is rapidly expanding.\nObjects in the field range from Sol-D2 to Sol-D681,\nnot counting small debris.\n-----\nThe center of this field has coordinates\nsimilar to previously known locations of Sol-D.\n-----\nAnd Earth is not found...?\n-----\nSol-D not found.\n-----\nWhat...
